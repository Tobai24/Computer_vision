## Computer Vision Project 👁️‍🗨️

This repository contains various computer vision projects I'm working on, showcasing different applications of deep learning models for image and video analysis.

### Projects 🚀

1. **Face Recognition 👤**

   - This app uses **MTCNN** (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) and **InceptionResnetV1** for face recognition in videos. It detects and labels faces in video streams.
   - Check the `README` file in the **face_recognition** folder for detailed instructions on how to set it up and run it locally. 📝

2. **Object Detection (YOLOv11) 🚗**

   - This project utilizes **YOLOv11** (You Only Look Once) for object detection in videos, specifically focusing on detecting moving cars on the street.
   - Check the `README` file in the **object_detection** folder for detailed instructions on how to use and run the model. 🚙

3. **Polyp Detection (YOLOv11) 🩺**
   - This model is fine-tuned on the **YOLOv11** architecture, leveraging its pre-trained weights to effectively detect polyps in gastrointestinal images.
   - Check the `README` file in the **polyps_yolo_detection** folder for setup instructions and further details on the fine-tuned model.

### Setup Instructions ⚙️

For detailed instructions on how to run each project, including dependencies and environment setup, refer to the respective `README` files in each project folder. 📚
