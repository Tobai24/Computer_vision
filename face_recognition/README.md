# **Face Recognition App ðŸ‘¤**

This folder contains the files needed to run a Flask-based API for face recognition. The application leverages **MTCNN** (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) for face detection and **InceptionResnetV1** for face recognition. It is designed to detect and label faces in video streams.

### **How It Works**

Upload a video featuring any of the co-hosts of the "What Now?" podcast, and the app will detect their faces in the video.
